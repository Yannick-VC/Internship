${Bold}How many people can play this game?${Normal}
This game is designed to be a single-player game but can be deployed on 1 VM and everyone
can brainstorm together and come up with ways to tackle the scenario.

${Bold}What is the aim of the game?${Normal}
The aim of the game is to hack your way through several AWS resources ranging from databases
to webservers to IAM systems etc. whilst answering questions (like a Capture The Flag (CTF) game).

${Bold}How do I start a scenario?${Normal}
When you are ready to tackle the challenge, press '1' to play the scenario.

${Bold}How do I quit the game?${Normal}
If you wish to quit the game, without having started a challenge or at the end of one, simply press '4' to quit the application.

${Bold}What if, whilst playing the game, I try to quit the game?${Normal}
In this case there are 2 options:
	- Exhaust your guesses (wrongly answer the questions) until you have no guesses left and the game will terminate itself.
	- Force quit the game which will let the resources live and exist. Afterwards you have to manually go into
 	  folder of the scenario and type 'terraform destroy -auto-approve' and wait till there is a green box saying "x resources destroyed".

${Bold}Things to note:${Normal}
	- Answers must be given with respect to upper and lowercase. (e.g. "FooBar" is not the same as "foobar")
	- The player has a total of 35 guesses spread over 7 questions. (so that a player can have 5 guesses per question)
	- The games must be played on a completely new Linux VM. (to avoid the installed and configured items from not working as intend)
	- You must have fun whilst playing ;)
